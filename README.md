## Project Overview
The Employee Management System is a Java-based desktop application that provides a user-friendly interface for managing employee data. This project allows the user to perform various operations such as adding and viewing employee details, managing attendance, applying for leave, generating salary slips, and updating employee information. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using `JFrame`, `JMenuBar`, and `JMenuItem` components to create an interactive and organized workspace.

The main class, `HomePage`, sets up the primary window and menu items, and implements navigation between different functionalities through action listeners.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/[YourUsername]/[YourRepoName].git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Build and run the project.

## Project Structure
- **src/**: Contains all the Java source code files.
- **EmployeeManagement/**: The main package containing classes for the employee management system.
  - `HomePage.java`: This class creates the main window for the employee management system with a menu bar and navigation options.
  - `Add_Employee.java`: Allows the user to add new employee details.
  - `View_Employee.java`: Displays a list of employees.
  - `UpdateDetails_Data.java`: Used to update employee details.
  - `Employee_Attendance.java`: Manages the employee attendance.
  - `View_Attendance.java`: Displays employee attendance records.
  - `Apply_Leave.java`: Allows employees to apply for leave.
  - `View_Leave.java`: Shows the leave history of employees.
  - `Salary.java`: Manages the salary details of employees.
  - `Generate_PaySlip.java`: Generates salary slips for employees.

## Usage
1. Run the `HomePage` class from your IDE:
   ```bash
   java EmployeeManagement.HomePage
   ```
2. The main window will appear with a menu bar containing options for managing employee information:
   - **Profile**: Add and view employee details.
   - **Manage**: Update employee details.
   - **Attendance**: Manage and view employee attendance.
   - **Leave**: Apply for and view leave requests.
   - **Salary**: Add salary details and generate salary slips.
   - **Exit**: Logout and close the application.

Each menu item performs specific actions, such as opening forms for adding employee data, viewing attendance records, or generating pay slips.

## Conclusion
This Employee Management System project provides a practical demonstration of building a GUI-based application in Java using `JFrame`, `JMenuBar`, and `JMenuItem`. It effectively handles different aspects of employee management, such as employee information, attendance, leave, and salary management.
